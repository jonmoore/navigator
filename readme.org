This repo is an experiment in
1. exploring graph visualization using Python, including describing
   and assessing different options for this.
2. literate programming to write a combination of code and
   a written report for the graph visualization exploration.  This is
   done using [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]].

It includes:
- [[file:navigator.org]], an org mode file describing the problem and approaches being used,
  and containing the experimental code as org mode src blocks
  which are tangled to Python files.
- project setup files for git, pyproject, etc.
- files to set up the html export in a readthedocs-style theme.
- a couple of Jupyter notebooks not generated through org mode.

See [[file:navigator.org]] for the main content.
